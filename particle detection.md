kinetic theory of ideal gas:
$$
\frac{3}{2}k_{B}T= <KE>\text{of}\,\text{molecule}
$$
KE means kinetic energy.

> [!exercise] estimate the temperature needed to create a 100 GeV particles
> *kinetic theory applies to photon gas as well*
> kinetic theory of ideal gas:$$\frac{3}{2}k_{B}T= <KE>\text{of}\,\text{molecule}$$
> so $T=\frac{2}{3k_{B}}E\sim\frac{100 \times 10^9 \, \text{eV}}{8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K}} \approx 1.16 \times 10^{15} \, \text{K}$

the universe keeps expanding that makes temperature cooling down, when the rate of expansion exceed(lager than) the annihilation(meeting between particles and anti-particles) rate, "freeze-out" (decouple) happens. the relic(these long lived particles) will become the evidence of the 3rd question.

### CMB: cosmic microwave background
microwave is still fall down(?) that show the expansion and cooling down of the universe
gamma-ray photons meeting leads to **particle creation**: 1 electron & 1 anti-electron, while the inverse of such procession is called **annihilation**, sending out gamma rays

the microwave background forms by the **atoms forming ** when protons and $He^{+}$ capture electron. 

### proton and neutron can transform to each other
$$n\to p+e+\bar{\nu}_{e}\tag{1}$$
$$\bar{\nu}_{e}+p\to n+e^{+}$$
$M_{n}=939.57$MeV, $M_{p}=938.28$MeV
this happens by weak interaction.
> [!exercise] estimate at which temperature would proton stop turning into neutron
> $$n\to p+e+\bar{\nu}_{e}$$
$$\bar{\nu}_{e}+p\to n+e^{+}$$
$M_{n}=939.57$MeV, $M_{p}=938.28$MeV
> we should consider mass difference as energy change:$$
\Delta m = M_n - M_p = 939.57 - 938.28 = 1.29 \, \text{MeV}$$
> So when $k_B T \lesssim \Delta m$, there’s **not enough thermal energy** to produce neutrons from protons.
> at this time $$T_{\text{freeze}} \sim \frac{\Delta m}{k_B} = \frac{1.29 \, \text{MeV}}{k_B}\sim 10^{10}\text{K}$$

if the temperature is low enough, **proton will have no way to become to neutron**, so proton and e and $\bar{\nu}_{e}$ will be left, the former two combine to atoms and**the later one become relic** ^8e0145

### deuteron(氘核)
D=np
*free neutron will definitely decays (1)* but now they don't decay anymore, so $\bar{\nu}_{e}$ has no more production

> [!exercise] Can deuteron make beta decay? And why?
> No
> The reason is that the mass of deuteron is less than the sum of its parts after beta decay. First we know that a deuteron is made of n+p, and it's 2.2MeV lighter than total mass of n&p.
> Beta decay makes n into p+e+$\nu$, and the mass difference is the anti number of last question: $\Delta m=-1.29$MeV, so even the sum of the left parts' mass reduce, it's still heavier than deuteron.
> In other word, at least although there many deuterons in our drinking water, but we are save from the radiation.

### Big bang Nucleosynthesis
synthesis means composite
Nucleosynthesis:$p\to D\to T\to He^{+}$
#### nuclear relic
[[particle detection#^8e0145]] these neutrinos are cold(2K)

> [!exercise] If neutrino mass is 1 eV, estimate the relic neutrino's speed
> from the materials saying that the neutrinos are also cold, about 2K, so we can assume that $T_{\nu}=2$K
> to estimate speed we should know the momentum because: $v\sim \frac{p}{m}$
> The average momentum is approximately$$\langle p_\nu \rangle \approx 3.15 \, k_B T \approx 3.15 \times 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \times 2 \approx 5.43 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{eV}$$
> so $v\sim \frac{5.43\times10^{-4}\text{eV}}{1\text{eV}}\sim5.43\times 10^{-4}c$

## Unit 2. Neutrinos and weak interactions
there are neutrinos distributing in a big range of energy, formed from many processions

###  an indirect detection
is to capture the single energy taken by the neutron newly created by the process named "*electron capture*"
 $e+p\to n+\nu_{e}$
only n is massive to take energy, which is different from classical mechanics

another way is man-made: Nuclear Reactors/Bombs
an experience: $1\text{Fission}\implies 200\text{MeV}\implies6\bar{\nu}_{e}$

### inverse $\beta$ decay
$$
\bar{\nu}+p\to n +e
$$
which is the inverse of
$$
n\to p+e^{-}+\bar{\nu}
$$
### bubble chamber
different from cloud chamber, which is sensitive to *charged particles*, can be used for detecting Neutral current（中性线电流）created by transition of $Z^{0}$
first leptonic NC event  interpreted by: $\bar{\nu} e\to \bar{\nu}e$

sun mass=$2\times10^{30}$kg, 10% of the mass transform to energy(via proton-proton fuse into He4 in the core), sun will burn for 10 billion years.
$$
p+p+p+p\implies He4=\alpha+e^{+}+e^{+}+\nu_{e}+\nu_{e}
$$
> [!exercise] estimate the number of electron neutrino per second created from the sun
> $M_{\odot}=2\times 10^{30}\text{kg}$, energy is released via proton-proton fuse into He4 in the core, about 10% of the mass. the sun will burn for 10 billion years.
> the nuclear equation is:
> $$
p+p+p+p\implies He4=\alpha+e^{+}+e^{+}+\nu_{e}+\nu_{e}$$
> Mass of the fusion is $M=2\times 10^{29}\text{kg}$, mass of protons per reaction is $4m_p \approx 4 \times 1.67 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} = 6.68 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}$, so the number of the reactions is $$
N = \frac{M}{6.68 \times 10^{-27}} \approx \frac{2 \times 10^{29}}{6.68 \times 10^{-27}} \approx 3 \times 10^{55}$$
> according to the nuclear equation, each reaction gives 2 neutrinos, so its number is:$$
N_{\nu}=2N=6 \times 10^{55}$$
> We also know the burn time:$$t = 10^{10} \, \text{years} = 3.15 \times 10^{17} \, \text{s}$$
> so we get the rate of the neutrinos' radiation:
> $$
\frac{dN_{\nu}}{dt} = \frac{6 \times 10^{55}}{3.15 \times 10^{17}} \approx 1.9 \times 10^{38} \, \nu/\text{s}$$
